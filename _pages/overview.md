The goal of this exercise is to take the FedRAMP documentation and incorporate into the Markdown standards and format.

Documented content can have bugs, too, and need the loving care of contributions.

The active and passive inconsistencies to the authoritative sources (ie; the word docs) have been corrected:

  * Table lettering and numbering
  * Spacing, carriage returns, leading zeros
  * Typos
  * Table formatting
  * Different font sizes
  * Obvious different authors lead to inconsistent styles

Note that this is _not_ an official government site. This website and its code are to demonstrate automating Risk Management Framework documentation.
