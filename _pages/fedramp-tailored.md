# 1. Information System Name

This FedRAMP *Tailored* Low Impact Software as a Service (LI-SaaS)
Framework provides an overview of the security requirements for the
{{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name }} ({{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name-short }}) and
describes the controls in place or planned for implementation to provide
a level of security appropriate for the information to be transmitted,
processed, or stored by the system. Information security is vital to our
critical infrastructure and its effective performance and protection is
a key component of our national security program. Proper management of
information technology (IT) systems is essential to ensure the required
risk impact level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the
data transmitted, processed, or stored by the {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name-short }} system is in 
place and operating as intended.

The security safeguards implemented for the {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name-short }} system meet
the policy and control requirements set
forth in this FedRAMP *Tailored* LI-SaaS Framework. All systems are
subject to monitoring, consistent with applicable laws, regulations,
agency policies, procedures, and practices.

**Table 1‑1. Information System Identifier, Name, and Abbreviation**

| Unique Identifier                | Information System Name             | Information System Abbreviation       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------| ------------------------------------- |
| {{ page.system-security-plan.id }} | {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name }} | {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name-short }}                              |

# 2. Information System Categorization

The overall {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name-short }}sensitivity categorization is recorded in Table 2.1, Security Categorization, which follows. The completed FedRAMP FIPS 199 document is included in this document as
Attachment 3 – FedRAMP FIPS Security Categorization.

**Table 2‑1. System Security Categorization**

|  **System Sensitivity Level:**                             |            |

## 2.1. Information Types

This section describes how the information types used by
{{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name-short }} are categorized for confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitivity levels.

The following tables identify the information types that are input,
stored, processed, and/or output from {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name-short }}.
The selection of the information types is based on
guidance provided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Federal
Enterprise Architecture (EA) Program Management Office (PMO) Business
Reference Model 2.0, National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 199,
*Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
Information Systems*, and NIST Special Publication 800-60 (NIST SP
800-60) , *Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information
Systems to Security Categories*.

FIPS 199\[1\] allows for a full range of information types. In order to
meet specific, niche needs of systems, Agencies can specify the types of
information being placed in the cloud environment. For FedRAMP
*Tailored* LI-SaaS, Agencies can specify the type(s) of information that
will reside in FedRAMP *Tailored* LI-SaaS applications/systems.

To be considered a FedRAMP *Tailored* LI-SaaS cloud application/service,
the answer to all of the following questions must be “yes:”

1.  Does the service operate in a cloud environment?

2.  Is the cloud service fully operational?

3.  Is the cloud service a Software as a Service (SaaS), as defined by
    NIST SP 800-145, The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing?

4.  Does the cloud service contain no personally identifiable
    information (PII), except as needed to provide a login capability
    (username, password and email address)?

5.  Is the cloud service low-security-impact, as defined by FIPS PUB
    199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information
    and Information Systems?

6.  Is the cloud service hosted within a FedRAMP-authorized Platform as
    a Service (PaaS) or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), or is the
    CSP providing the underlying cloud infrastructure?

**Table 2‑3. Sensitivity Categorization of Information Types for the**

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Information Type</p>
<p>(Use only information types from NIST SP 800-60, Volumes I and II as amended)</p></th>

## 2.2. Security Objectives Categorization (FIPS 199)

Based on the information provided in Table 2.3, Sensitivity
Categorization of Information Types for the {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name-short }} default to the high-water mark for the Information
Types as identified in Table 2.4, Security Impact Level, below.

If the security impact level for confidentiality, integrity, and
availability for any of the identified data types is moderate or high,
the information system is not a FedRAMP *Tailored* LI-SaaS system. The
Cloud Service Provider (CSP) must meet the standard FedRAMP Low,
Moderate, or High impact baseline security requirements, as applicable,
and complete the requirement documentation.

**Table 2‑4. Security Impact Level**

| Security Objective  | Low, Moderate or High |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Confidentiality** | {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.    security-impact-level.security-objective-confidentiality }}             |
| **Integrity**       | {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.    security-impact-level.security-objective-integrity }}                   |
| **Availability**    | {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.    security-impact-level.security-objective-availability }}                |

Through careful review and analysis, the baseline security
categorization for the {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name-short }} system has
been determined and is listed in Table 2.5, Baseline Security
Configuration, which follows.

**Table 2‑5. Baseline Security Configuration**

|  **Baseline Security Configuration:**                             |            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.system-name }} | {{ page.system-security-plan.system-characteristics.security-sensitivity-level }} Impact |

Using this categorization, in conjunction with the risk assessment and
any unique security requirements, the security controls for this system
have been established as detailed in this FedRAMP *Tailored* LI-SaaS
Framework.

# 3. Information System Owner 

The following individual is identified as the system owner or functional

| Does the system have the ability to expand its capacity to meet customer demand?                | A no response means that the system is most likely not a cloud.                                                                                                        |
| Does the system allow the customer to build anything other than servers?                        | A no response means that the system is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). A yes response means that the system is either a Platform as a Service (PaaS) or a SaaS. |
| Does the system offer the ability to create databases?                                          | A yes response means that the system is a PaaS.                                                                                                                        |
| Does the system offer various developer toolkits and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)? | A yes response means that the system is a PaaS.                                                                                                                        |
| Does the system offer only applications that are available by obtaining a login?                | A yes response means that system is a SaaS. A no response means that the system is either a PaaS or an IaaS.                                                           |
